         * ***********  Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:*************
         * OOP is faster and easier to execute
         * OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
         * OOP helps to keep the Java code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
         * OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time
