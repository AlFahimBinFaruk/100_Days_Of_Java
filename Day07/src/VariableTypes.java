    /****
     * In Java There are mainly three types of variables:
     *
     * 01.Static/Class => A static/class variable can be defined using the static keyword.
     *                    These variables are declared inside a class but outside a method and code block.
     *
     * 02.Instance/Global => An instance variable in Java can be declared outside a block,
     *                       method or constructor but inside a parent class.This can be accessed anywhere.
     *
     * 03.Local => local variable in Java can be declared locally in methods, code blocks, and constructors.
     *             variables that are created inside local variables cannot be accessed outside of it.
