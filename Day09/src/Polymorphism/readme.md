### What is Polymorphism?
* Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.
  Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class.
  Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks.
  This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.

* Polymorphism is considered one of the important features of Object-Oriented Programming.
  Polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways.
  In other words, polymorphism allows you to define one interface and have multiple implementations.
  The word “poly” means many and “morphs” means forms, So it means many forms.

* There are Two types of polymorphism.
    * 01.Static/Compile time -> method,constructor overloading.
    * 02.Dynamic/Run Time -> method overriding.
