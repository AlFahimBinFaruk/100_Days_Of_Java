### Linked List.
* The LinkedList class is a collection which can contain many objects of the same type, just like the ArrayList.
* How the LinkedList works
  * The LinkedList stores its items in "containers." The list has a link to the first container and each container has a link to the next container in the list. To add an element to the list, the element is placed into a new container and that container is linked to one of the other containers in the list.
* Linked list class uses doubly linked list to store the items.
* Manipulation of data is fast here (deleting and inserting).
* Can contain duplicate elements.
