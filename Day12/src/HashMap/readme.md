### Hashmap.
* A HashMap however, store items in "key/value" pairs, and you can access them by an index of another type (e.g. a String).
* Keys and values in a HashMap are actually objects.
  Remember that a String in Java is an object (not a primitive type). To use other types, such as int, 
  you must specify an equivalent wrapper class: Integer. 
  for example the wrapper class of primitive data type **int** is **Integer**.
  For other primitive types, use: Boolean for boolean, Character for char, Double for double, etc.
