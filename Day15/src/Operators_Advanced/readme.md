## Operators.
* Java divides the operators into the following groups:
  * Arithmetic operators
  * Assignment operators
  * Comparison operators
  * Logical operators
  * Bitwise operators
  
#### Arithmetic Operators
* Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.
  * Example : +,-,*,/,%,++,--

#### Assignment Operators
* Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.
  * Example : =,+=,-=,*=,/=,%=,&=,|=,^= ,>>=,<<=
