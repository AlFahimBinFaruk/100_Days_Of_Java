### OOP In Java.
* OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.
* Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data, 
  while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.
* Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:
  * OOP is faster and easier to execute
  * OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
  * OOP helps to keep the Java code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
    * The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the codes that are common for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it.
  * OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time

### Java - What are Classes and Objects?
* Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming.
  * class => Car.
    * object => BMW,Audi,Volvo.
* So, a class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.
* When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the variables and methods from the class.

### Very Important Points.
* **In Java, an object is created from a class.**
* Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects, along with its **attributes** and **methods**.
