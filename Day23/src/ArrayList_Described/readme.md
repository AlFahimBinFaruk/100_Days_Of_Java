## See Day 04 JavaArrayList for code examples.

### ArrayList
* The ArrayList class is a **resizable** array, which can be found in the java.util package.
* The difference between a built-in array and an ArrayList in Java, is that the size of an array cannot be modified (if you want to add or remove elements to/from an array, you have to create a new one). While elements can be **added** ,**modified**,**sorted** and  **removed** from an ArrayList whenever you want. The syntax is also slightly different
