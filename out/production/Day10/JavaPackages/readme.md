### Java Packages.
* A package is a group of related classed,interfaces and sub-classes.Example:Network related all class are under network package.
* A package in Java is used to group related classes. Think of it as a folder in a file directory. 
  We use packages to avoid name conflicts, and to write a better maintainable code. 
* Packages are divided into two categories:
  * Built-in Packages (packages from the Java API)
  * User-defined Packages (create your own packages)

### Built-in Packages
* The Java API is a library of pre-written classes, 
  that are free to use, included in the Java Development Environment(JDK/JDE).
* The library contains components for managing input, database programming, and much much more. 
* The complete list can be found at Oracles <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/">website</a>.
* The library is divided into packages and classes. 
  Meaning you can either import a single class (along with its methods and attributes), 
  or a whole package that contain all the classes that belong to the specified package.
